    <!-- Intro -->
    <p>There is not much in this world that pairs better than chocolate and chiles. We are were so excited when Sensient Natural Ingredients(link is external) shared this recipe(link is external) with us and instantly ran to our kitchens to test it out. If you can get your hands on the key ingredient here: Sensient Natural Ingreadients Organic Ancho Chili Powder, then you are in for a real treat! If you're in a pinch and need a substitution, then you can use 1/2 powdered cayenne pepper and 1/2 smoked paprika instead (or all cayenne if you don't mind the heat and are missing the paprika as well).</p>
